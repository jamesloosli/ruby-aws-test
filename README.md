ruby-aws-test
=============

Doing some testing with the AWS API in Ruby. Fun stuff.

I wrote this on an OSX 10.9 Machine running Ruby 2.0.0

The gemfile should work for you. Alternatively, you can manually install the two required gems (asw-sdk and uuid) yourself using gem install.

The only other requirement to get this working is to add your AWS credentials to config/aws.rb. There is an example file in config/ if you need help.
